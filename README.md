# py-ral-goog
The project will help you query Rally Kanban boards, create user stories, features, and tasks in Rally, and use a Google form to create Rally features. It includes two libraries, rally_connector.py and google_connector.py, which contain classes to help you connect and use both tools. The project also contains a command line interface, py-ral-goog.py, that relies on a YAML file, config.yaml, to connect to your Rally environment.

I'll explain how to use the project from the command line below.
